# Monopoly project

This project is our practice in OOP. Something we design and customize following member's ideas such as bot, mini-game, chracter, UI,.. , especially mini-game. Although we try to coding too much, there are something wrong in our code. We have to learn more to finish this project.

Beside this fail, we are success in generating a mini-game, which is pirate and crab game from Youtube. Because it is a mini-game, we cut off some features for saving time
